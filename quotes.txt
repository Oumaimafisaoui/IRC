Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.
I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to handle. But if you can't handle me at my worst, then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my best.
Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.
You only live once, but if you do it right, once is enough.
Be the change that you wish to see in the world.
In three words I can sum up everything I've learned about life: it goes on.
If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.
Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.
To live is the rarest thing in the world. Most people exist, that is all.
I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.
A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.
Without music, life would be a mistake.
As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep: slowly, and then all at once.
We accept the love we think we deserve.
